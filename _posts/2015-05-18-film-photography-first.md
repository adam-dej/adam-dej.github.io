I was introduced to the world of B/W film photography by a friend, and I've
decided to try it, including developing the film myself. This is how it went
down.

For quite some time I've had in my possesion several old cameras. I wasn't
using them until now. The oldest one I have is **Flexaret III**, more than 65
years old. It is a Twin Lens Reflex camera manufactured by Meopta in
Czechoslovakia. The camera is fully mechanical, equipped with Mirar II 80/3.5
and Prontor-SVS (B, 1-1/300s) shutter. It uses 120 roll film.

I wondered whether the camera still works, and was given two films, Fomapan 100
and Fomapan 200. After destroying the Fomapan 100 film by rewinding it too much
( :( ) I've sucessfully loaded Fomapan 200, and with tutoring of a friend took
first photos.

After exposing the film it was time to pay a visit to the dark room. For this
was the first time I was developing a film on my own I've written a simple
checklist and had it checked by a responsible person. I've used Rodinal
developer and Fomafix fixer at 24째 C. At this temperature processing time went
down from 9 minutes to about 6. This was my process (disclaimer: This is not
necessarily correct, nor are these instructions for the general public, it is
just a log of what I've done):

  * Check all chemicals
    * Tempered water
    * Developer
    * Fixer
      * Check whether the fixer is still good
    * Wetting agent
  * Check all tools
    * Developing tank
    * Chemical glass
    * Thermometer
    * Scissors, pen
    * Timer
  * Cut the film
  * Check whether the room is really dark and secure
  * Wind the film onto developing reels, seal the developing tank
  * Turn on the lights (my developing tank is completely opaque and doesn't
    need to be used in darkness)
  * Dilute the developer (I've used 1+50 dilution of Rodinal, meaning 1 unit of
    Rodinal for 50 units of water)
  * Find how long you should be developing the film (Fomapan 200 + 1+50 Rodinal
    was 9 minutes @ 20째C)
  * Compensate for the developer temperature by adjusting development time
    (from 9 minutes @ 20째C it went down to 6 minutes @ 24째C)
  * Start the countdown and pour in the developer
  * Agitate (turn upside down at moderate speeds) the developing tank
    * Continuously for the first 30 seconds
    * oFr 10 seconds at the beginning of every minute
  * Immediately after the timer finishes, pour out the developer and pour in
    the stop bath quickly
    * I've used water as a stop bath
  * Pour in the fixer, start the countdown (3 minutes for the Fomafix)
    * The Fomafix can be reused, so pour it back to the bottle afterwards
  * Wash the film
    * Pour the water to the development dose, turn N times, change the water
      * Where N is 5, 10, 20, 20
  * Sink the film in wetting agent and hang it to dry

Using this process I was able to sucessfully develop the film on the first try.

The end of the film is destroyed, along with 2 pictures, because the film was
not wound tightly enough on the takeup reel and the end was exposed to
daylight. One frame is skipped at the beginning of the film, again, due to an
error in rewinding it, but the remaining 8 pictures are looking good :).

The next step is to make prints out of these, but it will be a different story
sometime later.
